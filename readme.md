# Edit-distance

My personal project to measure edit distances of words specified.

# How this works

This code takes in two CSV files, each containing:
- List of words to be calculated
- List of words to be referenced

The output will be a CSV file with specified data:
- The list of words to be calculated
- Lowest edit distance against the list of words to be referenced
- The reference words with the associated lowest edit distance


# Thanks to
TBD!
